### Goal
Fix camera preview overlay alignment in eyeTerm (GazeTerminal) — the green face bounding box, cyan eye contours, and red pupil dots were drifting from the actual face position, especially at frame edges. Also fix a calibration freeze bug discovered during testing.

### Accomplished
- Fixed overlay coordinate mapping in `CameraPreviewView.swift` to account for aspect-ratio differences between the camera feed and the preview window
- Changed `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` from `.resizeAspect` (letterboxed) to `.resizeAspectFill` (fills entire view, matching MediaPipe behavior)
- Replaced hardcoded 4:3 aspect ratio with dynamic query of the camera device's actual `activeFormat` dimensions via `CMVideoFormatDescriptionGetDimensions`
- Computed aspect-fill rect so overlay coordinates map to the correct position even when the video is cropped
- Updated `FaceOverlayShape` and `EyeRegionShape` to accept a `CGRect` (video rect) instead of `CGSize` (view size), offsetting all coordinates by the rect's origin
- Fixed calibration freeze bug: second calibration run would freeze the entire UI because (a) `EyeTermEstimator` applies calibration transform before returning `gaze.point`, so re-calibration fed already-calibrated data into the solver, making it degenerate, and (b) if `solve3x3` returned nil, `finishCalibration()` exited without calling `onCalibrationComplete`, leaving the `.screenSaver`-level overlay window stuck on screen
- Fix: `AppCoordinator.startCalibration()` now clears `activeBackend.calibrationTransform` before starting, and `finishCalibration()` falls back to `.identity` transform on solve failure
- Initialized git repo and made initial commit
- Updated Claude Code to latest version via npm

### In Progress / Incomplete
- User has not yet tested the latest build with dynamic aspect ratio detection — needs to verify overlay accuracy on both MediaPipe and Apple Vision backends
- No remote git repository configured yet — only local

### Key Decisions
- Used `.resizeAspectFill` instead of `.resizeAspect` to match MediaPipe's behavior of filling the entire preview window (no bars)
- Queried actual camera dimensions at runtime rather than hardcoding, since Mac cameras vary (720p, 1080p, different aspect ratios)
- Chose to fall back to `.identity` transform on calibration solve failure rather than silently ignoring — ensures overlay always dismisses

### Files Changed
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/UI/CameraPreviewView.swift` — aspect-fill video rect, dynamic camera aspect ratio, videoRect-based overlay mapping
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/App/AppCoordinator.swift` — clear calibration transform before re-calibration
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/CalibrationManager.swift` — dismiss overlay on solve failure
- `.gitignore` — created to exclude build/, .DS_Store, DerivedData, xcuserdata

### Known Issues
- Overlay accuracy on Apple Vision backend still needs user verification after the dynamic aspect ratio fix
- MediaPipe Python process coordinate space vs Apple Vision coordinate space: MediaPipe coords come from OpenCV (may or may not be mirrored depending on the Python script), Apple Vision coords come from raw pixel buffer (unmirrored). Both use `(1 - pt.x)` for horizontal flip in the overlay — if one backend's coords are pre-mirrored, this could cause horizontal inversion for that backend.

### Running Services
- No running processes. eyeTerm was force-killed during calibration freeze debugging.

### Next Steps
- Launch eyeTerm, test overlay accuracy on both backends (MediaPipe and Apple Vision) with dynamic aspect ratio
- If horizontal alignment is still off on one backend, investigate whether MediaPipe Python script mirrors the frame before face detection (check `Resources/gaze_tracker.py`)
- Set up a remote git repository if desired

### Goal
Continue gaze tracking pipeline development — fix bugs, add independent head/pupil calibration, add debug visualization tools, fix iTerm AppleScript authorization, add voice audio waveform visualizer, and push to GitHub.

### Accomplished
- **Camera restart fix**: `EyeTermTracker.stop()` now removes all inputs/outputs from AVCaptureSession so the camera can restart cleanly
- **Quadrant driven by smoothed point**: Changed MediaPipe backend to always use `ScreenQuadrant.from(normalizedPoint: smoothedPoint)` instead of letting Python's raw quadrant override
- **Vertical tracking fix (Apple Vision)**: Changed pitch normalization divisor from 0.6 to 0.3
- **Head pose fix (Apple Vision)**: Added two-step Vision request — `VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest` first for reliable yaw/pitch, then `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` with `inputFaceObservations`
- **Slider now functional on both backends**: MediaPipe fusion moved from Python (hardcoded 0.85) to Swift side using raw head_yaw/head_pitch/iris_ratio_x/iris_ratio_y components
- **Multiple gaze inversion corrections** across both backends (head and pupil, took several iterations)
  - Apple: `headX = 0.5 - (yaw / 1.0)`, `headY = 0.5 + (pitch / 0.3)`
  - MediaPipe: `headX = 0.5 - (headYaw / 1.0)`, `headY = 0.5 - (headPitch / 0.6)`
  - MediaPipe pupil: `1.0 - irisRatioX`, `1.0 - irisRatioY`
- **Separate raw/calibrated points**: `EyeTermGazeResult` now returns both `rawPoint` and `calibratedPoint`
- **Head/pupil visualization**: Debug overlay shows orange person.fill (head), green eye.fill (pupil), white fusion line with slider-position dot
- **Independent calibration**: `CalibrationManager` records head and pupil samples separately, computes dual affine transforms. Backend protocol has `headCalibrationTransform` and `pupilCalibrationTransform`
- **Calibrated head/pupil visualization**: Outlined icons and yellow fusion line for calibrated signals
- **Dwell progress border**: Cyan border stroke that grows during dwell, solid when confirmed
- **Debug smoothing slider**: EMA filters for all 6 debug visualization points (head, pupil, cal head, cal pupil, raw fused, cal fused) — separate from pipeline smoothing
- **Voice audio level**: `onAudioLevel` callback from VoiceEngine, wired to AppState
- **Floating waveform panel**: Whisper-style `AudioWaveformView` in a floating NSPanel at bottom-center, auto-shows/hides with voice start/stop. 64-bar scrolling amplitude display
- **Audio level meter**: 5-bar indicator in menu bar voice section
- **iTerm AppleScript authorization**: Added `NSAppleEventsUsageDescription` to Info.plist, moved `NSAppleScript` execution to main thread via `@MainActor`
- **Terminal window tiling**: Uses `NSScreen.visibleFrame` (excludes menu bar/dock) instead of full frame. Proper coordinate conversion from macOS bottom-left to AppleScript top-left origin
- **No longer closes existing iTerm windows**: Removed `close every window` from setup, teardown only closes managed windows (by index, in reverse order)
- **GitHub repo created**: https://github.com/brianharms/eyeTerm (private)

### In Progress / Incomplete
- User has not yet tested this build — plans to test tomorrow
- L2CS-Net CoreML backend integration (deferred, see TODO section below)

### Key Decisions
- UIKit window-level UIPanGestureRecognizer for chat swipe dismiss (from prior projectQ work, noted in CLAUDE.md)
- Two-step Vision framework approach because `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` alone doesn't reliably populate yaw/pitch
- Independent calibration before fusion allows the head/eye slider to work post-calibration
- Debug smoothing is visualization-only (doesn't affect actual gaze pipeline)
- Floating waveform panel chosen over menu bar indicator for visibility
- Ad-hoc code signing (`CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"`) may still prevent TCC prompts on fresh installs — user should switch to Personal Team signing in Xcode if authorization dialogs don't appear

### Files Changed
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/App/AppState.swift` — added audioLevel, isSpeaking, audioLevelHistory, debugSmoothing, calibratedHeadGazePoint, calibratedPupilGazePoint, dwellingQuadrant, dwellProgress, headGazePoint, pupilGazePoint
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/App/AppCoordinator.swift` — debug EMA filters, waveform panel management, audio level wiring, calibration dual-transform wiring
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/GazeEstimator.swift` — EyeTermDiagnostics with head/pupil/calibrated points, dual calibration transforms, sign corrections
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/GazeTracker.swift` — two-step Vision request, session cleanup on stop, dual calibration proxying
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/MediaPipeBackend.swift` — Swift-side fusion from raw components, dual calibration, sign corrections
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/EyeTrackingBackend.swift` — dual calibration transform protocol
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/CalibrationManager.swift` — dual sample recording, dual transform computation, CalibrationResult struct
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/GazeTracking/ScreenQuadrant.swift` — `appleScriptBounds(for:visibleFrame:)` with proper coordinate conversion
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/Terminal/TerminalManager.swift` — no longer closes existing windows, teardown closes only managed windows
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/Terminal/WindowLayout.swift` — uses visibleFrame
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/Terminal/AppleScriptBridge.swift` — `@MainActor runAsync`
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/UI/GazeOverlayView.swift` — head/pupil icons, fusion lines, calibrated visualization, dwell progress border, HUD legend
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/UI/AudioWaveformView.swift` — new file, floating waveform panel
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/UI/MenuBarView.swift` — AudioLevelView, voice section layout
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/UI/SettingsView.swift` — debug smoothing slider
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/Utilities/DwellTimer.swift` — onDwellProgress callback
- `Sources/GazeTerminal/Voice/VoiceEngine.swift` — onAudioLevel callback
- `Info.plist` — NSAppleEventsUsageDescription
- `GazeTerminal.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` — AudioWaveformView.swift added

### Known Issues
- Ad-hoc code signing may silently block TCC AppleEvent prompts on fresh machines — needs Personal Team signing for reliable authorization dialogs
- Gaze inversions were corrected through iterative testing but have not been verified on other machines/cameras
- `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME = NO` in both Debug and Release configs — would need hardened runtime for notarization/distribution

### Running Services
- eyeTerm app may still be running in the menu bar (launched during testing)

### Next Steps
- User plans to test the full build tomorrow (eye tracking, calibration, voice, terminal control)
- If AppleScript auth still fails, switch to Personal Team signing in Xcode
- Test voice waveform panel visibility and responsiveness
- Verify terminal window tiling respects dock/menu bar correctly
- Consider L2CS-Net CoreML integration when ready (see TODO section)

## TODO — Future Features

### L2CS-Net CoreML Backend (Third Tracking Backend)
- Convert L2CS-Net PyTorch model to CoreML via coremltools (PyTorch → ONNX → CoreML)
- Creates a fully native third backend — no Python subprocess, no C++ dependencies
- L2CS-Net predicts gaze yaw/pitch angles from a single webcam frame with ~3.9 degree accuracy (best of evaluated options)
- MobileGaze variant (MobileNet/MobileOne backbones) available for faster inference
- Integration path: load .mlmodel in Swift, feed camera frames, get yaw/pitch, fuse with existing head/eye weight system
- Repo: github.com/Ahmednull/L2CS-Net (Apache 2.0 license)
- Lightweight variant: github.com/yakhyo/gaze-estimation
